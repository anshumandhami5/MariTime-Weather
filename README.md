* **Python 3.x**
* **pip** (Python package installer)

### Backend & Machine Learning Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install Backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the Machine Learning directory :**
    ```bash
    cd "ML Services" 
    ```
4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
5.  **Run the Data Cleaning Script:**
    ```bash
    python data_cleaning.py
    ```
6.  **Run the Model Training Script:**
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
7.  **Start the ML Server (if it's a separate process):**
    ```bash
    python server.py 
    ```
8.  **Go to the Backend directory and start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend .. 
    npm start # to start backend
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend 
    ```
2.  **Install Frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or 'yarn dev'
    ```

Your application should now be running! Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port, or check your console for the correct URL).
